# ImageGlitch
A library of methods for "glitching" images

## Using
### Quick and Dirty
Download the content of the src directory to the location of your choice.
Compile the contents of src by navigating to their directory and type `javac [filename1] [filename2] ... [filenamen]` where in this case, the filenames are ImageManip.java, ImageGlitcher.java, and ResourceGenerator.java. (Requires a JDK)
After this has completed, there will be three new .class files in the directory.
Add the jpeg image of your choosing to this directory, and rename it "in.jpg"
Type `java ImageManip` into the command line to run the demo.
### Custom glitches
After downloading/cloning the repo, edit ImageManip.java to make the collection of edits that you would like. you can also change the expected name of the input file and the name of the output file.

## Examples
The ImageManip class usually contains whatever I am testing at the time. There are no guarantees its default results will be even remotely interesting.

To see a collection of samples of the possibilities of this probram, see the Imgur album below.
